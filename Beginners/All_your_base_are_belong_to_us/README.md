## Approach
1. I started by googling "Brutus Cipher," hoping to find some clues or useful tools.

   And my guess was correct! It's related to Caesar Cipher!!

3. I used an online [Caesar Cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher) to decrypt the message.

   ```
   caesarissimplenoneedforbrutus
   ```
4. Now that I had the plaintext, I needed to hash it. Using an [MD5 Hash Generator](https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/), I turned the text into its MD5 hash.
   After that, I wrapped it in flag{} to get the final flag:

   ```
   flag{c945bb2173e7da5a292527bbbc825d3f}
   ```
   
## Flag: 
flag{c945bb2173e7da5a292527bbbc825d3f}
